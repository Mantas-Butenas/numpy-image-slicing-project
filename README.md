# Image Slicing and Comparison

This Python script demonstrates image slicing and comparison techniques using NumPy and Matplotlib. It takes an input image and performs vertical and horizontal slicing, followed by recombination for visual comparison.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script `main.py` using Python.
5. View the output image, which displays the original image along with the vertically and horizontally sliced versions for comparison.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main Python script for image slicing and comparison.
- `otter.jpg`: Example input image used for demonstration.
- `README.md`: This README file providing instructions and information about the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the dependencies required for running the script.
